    "\n",
    "So far, we have built a simple linear classifier. However, in practice, we often want to build more complex models that can learn more intricate patterns in the data. This means that we will add multiple layers to our model, making it a *deep neural network* (or in this case, rather a *shallow* neural network).\n",

    "\n",
    "For the breast cancer dataset, we will build a model with three hidden layers, each with a decreasing number of neurons. In between each layer, we will add an activation function. The activation function is a non-linear function that is applied to the output of each neuron in the layer. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns in the data. The most common activation functions are **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**, **sigmoid**, and **tanh**. ReLU is the most commonly used activation function in deep learning, as it is computationally efficient and helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The sigmoid function is often used in the output layer for binary classification problems, as it outputs a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid function, but it outputs values between -1 and 1.\n",

    "PyTorch provides activations functions as part of the [`torch.nn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch-nn) module. The most common activation functions are implemented as classes, and can be used as layers in the model. For example, to use the ReLU activation function, you can simply add [`nn.ReLU()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html#torch.nn.ReLU) to your model.\n",
